// Since LoadModules requires a fully initialized session with command-line flags,
// which conflicts with the test runner, we can't easily test the actual module loading.
// The main functionality is tested through integration tests and the actual application.
// This test file at least provides some coverage for the package and demonstrates
// the expected behavior with invalid input.
